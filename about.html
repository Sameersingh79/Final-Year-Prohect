							We are a team of passionate and dedicated group of engineers. 
							We decided to go with a web based application system in order to maximize its usage as accessing internet has become easier now for most of the population.
							As web browsers are available on almost all mobile devices and computer systems, this application will be easier to access, this is one of the reasons we came up with this idea.
							Each of us used our domain's knowledge to develop this system. Dividing  the work between our group was the most efficient way to develop this as each of us have a strong hold in some domain. Every member of this group had their equal contribution in developing this project and we couldn't be more proud of it.
							We hope this project serves its purpose very well. 
							Thank You
